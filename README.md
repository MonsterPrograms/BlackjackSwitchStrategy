# Blackjack Switch Strategy
A simple program created using the Blackjack Switch strategy, which tells you whether to switch your cards. After you have made your switch decision, the optimal strategy is not as simple as basic strategy because of the push 22 rule. A blackjack also pays even money 1:1 which gives the house their edge of approximately 0.20% with perfect strategy. I have created a [strategy chart](https://i.imgur.com/p5VJPuo.png) which can be used for Betconstruct's Blackjack Switch. This assumes the dealer stands on soft 17, but you can easily find the strategy for hit soft 17 online.

For each round:
- Enter the dealer's upcard.
- Enter the values of hand 1 (1st card & 3rd card).
- Enter the values of hand 2 (2nd card & 4th card).
- Once you have completed all fields, then the strategy is automatically displayed.

You can toggle the 'TopMost' checkbox if you want the program to overlap all the other programs. This can be useful when playing, so the program doesn't disappear when you are actually playing your hand and you won't have to reopen it from the taskbar.
